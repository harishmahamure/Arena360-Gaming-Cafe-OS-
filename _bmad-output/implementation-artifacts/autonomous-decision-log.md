# Autonomous run: decision log

Started 2026-10-23, while the user was away. The instruction was: "continue developing stories in loop, take recommended decision wherever needed and keep log."

Each entry gives the story, the decision point, the choice taken (the recommended option) and why. Review these when you're back; anything here can be reversed.

## Story 1.5: shared base components meet the accessibility floor

- **Spec approval:** self-approved, as instructed. Spec: `spec-1-5-shared-base-components-meet-the-accessibility-floor.md`.
- **Gallery location:** a separate dev-only app, `apps/gallery`, rather than a hidden route inside the Hub. Why: the Hub bundle stays clean, and Playwright/axe can run against a static preview.
- **StatusBadge themes:** dark and HC only. Why: the 1.4 decision keeps Hub-only tokens out of light.
- **TabControl URL sync:** the component reports the selected tab through `onchange`; the page updates the URL. Why: it keeps the component router-agnostic.

## Scope update (user, 2026-10-23)

- "Complete all of epics, one commit after stories." Scope is now every epic in `sprint-status.yaml` (1–14), in order, with one local commit per story. Still no pushes, deploys or remote operations.

## Story 1.6: Hub service starts as the single writer of its branch database

- **Spec approval:** self-approved. Spec: `spec-1-6-hub-service-starts-as-the-single-writer-of-its-branch-databa.md`.
- **Healthz port:** loopback `127.0.0.1:7409`, overridable with `--health-port`. Why: `/healthz` is loopback-only, so it doesn't break the "no inbound ports beyond 7400/7401" rule, and 7409 stays next to the Arena range.
- **Follower takeover:** none automatic. A follower stays a follower even after the lease expires. Why: promotion is manual and epoch-fenced (AD-11), and it arrives in a later story.
- **Data dir:** `%PROGRAMDATA%\Arena360\Hub` on Windows and the XDG data dir elsewhere, overridable with `--data-dir` or `ARENA_HUB_DATA_DIR`.
- **Writer job API:** a closure over the transaction, as a stand-in until Story 1.7 replaces it with `apply()`.
- **Crash test:** a re-invoked child process is killed with `Child::kill` right after it commits, so the test works the same on Linux and Windows.
- **Log ring:** daily JSONL files; files older than 14 days are deleted, then the oldest until the total is ≤ 50 MB.
- **Review process:** to save context over 417 stories, I check each diff by running the verification commands and reading the `--stat`, instead of reading every line of large diffs. The three independent reviewers still read the full diff.
- **1.5 review outcome:** 14 fixes and 10 rejections. Notable fix: disabled Buttons use `aria-disabled` and stay focusable, so the reason can be reached from the keyboard. AlertBadge keeps an empty live region mounted at count 0, so going from 0 to 1 is still announced.
